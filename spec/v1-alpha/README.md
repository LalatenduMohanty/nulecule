# Application Template

**NOTE**: This is a proof-of-concept effort that is expected to change dramatically.

## template.yaml

The yaml file is the primary file defining the application and relationship to dependencies. See [OpenShift documentation](http://docs.openshift.org/latest/using_openshift/templates.html).

```

name: String
description: String
appversion: String
specversion: String
graph: 
  - String

requirements:
 - persistantVolume:
  -   type: "claim"
      name: String
      accessModes:

      size: Integer # GB by default
```

* `name`: arbitrary name
* `description`: arbitrary description
* `appversion`: version of the application
* `specversion`: version of this specification, ex. "v1-alpha"
* `graph`: list of applications. Strings may either match a local graph sub directory or an another containerapp-spec compliant container image that can be pulled via a provider.
* `requirements`: list of requirements of this application, may include storage and is interpreted by the provider implementation.

## Directory Layout

```
├── template.yaml
├── Dockerfile
├── <provider_files_dir>
│   ├── ...
│   └── <provider_files>
└── README.md
```

* `template.yaml`: application template
* `Dockerfile`: standard packaging for this application metadata
* `<provider_files_dir>`: directories of provider-specific files referenced in manifest
  * `PROVIDER_FILES`: provider-specific files necessary for deploying to provider, e.g. kubernetes pod and service files.
* `README.md`: information for deploying this application targetted towards deployment ops sysadmin


## README.md

The README.md is the human-readable document for the sysadmin. It describes the application in enough detail so an operator can make parameterization and other deployment decisions.

NOTE: This is optional. It is possible for some applications to be "self-describing" through well-written descriptions and input validation.
