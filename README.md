# Container Application Specification

## Goals

1. Provide a simple, flexible way to describe a multi-container application, including all dependencies.
1. Provide a way for an application designer to describe an application while allowing a sysadmin a clear way to parameterize the deployment at runtime.
1. Provide a versioned specification for developer tools and runtime implementations to agree on.

## User Experience

### Kelly the System Administrator

Kelly is deploying an application that she's been provided by Acme Corp's internal developer team, led by Rufus. 

Kelly will read the `README` to discover the capabilities and start up requirements for this application. She will edit `params.conf` and then use `/usr/bin/atomic` to deploy the application by pointing at the `Atomicfile`.

````
cd appdirectory
atomic run Atomicfile
````

### Rufus the Developer

## Implementations

This is only a specification. Implementations may be written in any language.

### Developer tooling

Developer implementation provides tooling to help developers quickly package several containers as a unit. It may be as simple as generating a template to start from or as complex as a GUI to develop and provide graphical representation of the target deployment.

### Deployment tooling

Deployment implementation provides tooling for deploying the complete application using this spec.
